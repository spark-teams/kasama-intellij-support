# Modules

Kasama keeps track in which modules you are active.

In the Kasama view under **Modules**, you can see the breakdown of the different modules.
The view also displays the allocation between test code and production code.

Kasama uses snapshots to detect the modules you are active in.
If you are active in a certain module for a very short timespan (i.e. a few seconds), its activity might not be detected.
