# Refactorings

Refactorings play an essential role in software development.
IDEs like IntelliJ provide a rich set of automated refactoring tools.
However, most developers only use a small subset of them.

In order to improve your refactoring skills, Kasama keeps track of the automated IDE refactorings you are using over the time.
This helps you to discover some blind spots where you can actively try to use some kinds of refactorings more than before.

The refactoring stats can be accessed in the Kasama view under **Refactorings**.
