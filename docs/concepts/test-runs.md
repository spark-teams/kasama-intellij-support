# Test Runs

Writing and executing tests are crucial aspects of software development.
To assist you in analyzing your testing methodology, Kasama tracks the executed test runs together with the number of failed and succeeded tests and test suites.

!!! note

    Only test runs executed by an IntelliJ run config are monitored.
    Test runs executed directly on the command line are not monitored.

You can see all information on the tracked test runs in the Kasama view under **Test runs**.
