# Concepts

Like a fitness tracker, Kasama helps you keeping an eye on your coding practices, such as coding sessions, testing habits, and many more:

- **Coding sessions** - how long are you active in the IDE and for which project?
- **Modules** - Kasama tracks in which modules you are active and how the activity is split between test code and production code.
- **Version control (Git) interaction** - Discover the frequency of your commits, the size of each commit, the longevity of your branches, and the types of branches you predominantly work on over time.
- **Testing habits** - Learn about your testing habits, including how frequently you run test suites, their failure rate, and their size.
- **Refactoring usage** - Find out which tool-driven refactorings you use and identify blind spots of lesser used refactorings.
