# Coding Sessions

A coding session is a continuous period of time during which you are active in the IDE.
It starts automatically when UI activity is detected and ends when the IDE is idle for a certain amount of time (this can be configured in the settings), or when a break is started (can be configured under Digital Wellbeing).

Coding sessions can be viewed in the Kasama View under **Coding Sessions** as a list or diagram view.

In the list view, coding sessions can be edited and removed.

When editing a coding session, the name and type can be set.

The following types are currently available:

- Work
- Hobby
- Learning
- Coding Dojo
- Open Source

If a type is set for a coding session, you can filter by type in the diagram view.
